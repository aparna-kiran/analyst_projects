<p>This repository is a collection of my projects of data analysis.</p> 
<p>The credit_card directory contains SQL code for the analysis of credit card financial data such as </p> 
<ul>
  <li> Basic functions - Sorting and Cleansing </li>
  <li> Grouping Data by Year and Quarter </li>
  <li> Calculating Running Averages </li>
  <li> Time Series Analysis </li>
 </ul>
